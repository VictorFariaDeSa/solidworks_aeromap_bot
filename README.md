# solidworks_aeromap_bot
this is the code I use to automate the setup generation in solidworks for aeromap CFDs simulations
All the variables defined in this code were created for my specific aplication so if somepne wants to use is important the ajust de code changing for exemple:
  the data excel sheet;
  the destine folder;
  the parameters to change;
  the pictures used to locate de buttons.
